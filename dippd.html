                                        The client goals, which would normally be learned through communication, were

                                        were derived
                                        from <b class="highlight">Primary and Secondary Research</b> done through a

                                Not only did this project teach me the hard skills of <b class="highlight">front-end web
                                    development</b>, but it also gave
                                me a <b class="highlight">new perspective</b> and understanding which I consider very
                                valuable as a UX designer.
                                Having a diverse understanding and awareness of different people's frameworks will help

                                I also want to thank my teammates Joanna and Jonathan for being there for all 12 weeks
                                from ideation to execution.
                                Through working with them, I was able to further develop my soft skills and work as a
                                team to tackle the project.
