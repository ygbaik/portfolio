                    <p>Ventura Future is an exhibition curated by the cultural organization Ventura Project based
                        in Milan, Italy. The Ventura Future exhibition is focused on highlighting and promoting
                        contemporary design and new design talents. Designers are urged to apply to be a part of the
                        exhibition that's held during the annual Milan Design Week to share their work and ideas that'll
                        drive the future culture and direction of design.

                            <p>
                                There were many points of intervention that could be made for the microsite, but our
                                team decided to intervene at the <b class="highlight">pre-purchase point</b> and
                                encourage applications rom designers for the upcoming Ventura Future. This decision was
                                made to <b class="highlight">align with the organization's main goal</b> of
                                supporting and creating opportunities for emerging talent as the future of design
                                culture.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                With this goal in mind, our intervention proposed to project the the benefits of
                                participating in Ventura Future with the microsite to <b class="highlight">promote
                                    applications</b> and
                                increase engagement for the prospective exhibiting designers of the 2020 Ventura Future
                                event.

                                Prior to designing the microsite, our team decided to narrow down on the Dan Friedman
                                principles for the direction of the digital asset.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We decided to focus on second and third principle as the key driving factors of the
                                microsite's <b class="highlight">Visual Design</b> to adapt to the new digital medium as
                                a website.

                                The microsite uses past data from the 2019 exhibition to give prospective designers a
                                sense of the opportunity and benefits they open themselves up to by participating at the
                                exhibition. A shade of black and tint of white was used for the entire microsite to keep
                                the prestigious and elegant character of Ventura Future.

                            <h3>Retrospective</h3>
                            <p>
                                Through this project, I was able to learn 3 important lessons.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first was the <b class="highlight">importance of semantics and context</b> in the work we create. Having
                                content strategy was crucial for driving the process to strive in creating meaningful
                                works.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second reflection is the <b class="highlight">difference and relationship between graphic design and
                                interaction design</b>. Although having our foundation in graphic design immensely helped us
                                get going, when in the process of transferring the graphic asset qualities to the
                                digital asset, we realized that the principles we practiced didn't fully translate over
                                to the visual design of the interactions as simply as we implicitly thought it would be.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And finally, the third lesson I learned was the importance of <b class="highlight">design history and fundamental principles</b> in
                                design. Through studying our precedent designer, Dan Friedman, I was able to grasp the
                                freedom that comes from having solid principles. Previously, I had the misconception
                                that having regulations would be restricting, but now I embrace having systems for
                                working.
